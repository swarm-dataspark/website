DataSpark builds an application layer solution for data supply-demand transactions on the Swarm core, and proposes an innovative architecture of "Data-Base, Data-Source, Data-Core, Data-Usage", aiming to create a decentralized and distributed supply chain of data to promote the creation of a beautiful and inclusive artificial intelligence society. Through large-scale application deployment of DataSpark Dapp, global data producers and consumers are linked, so that everyone can become a distributor and beneficiary of their own data. In the data asset trading market created by DataSpark, C2B-DataEx model is currently available. We believe that people will no longer have the need to be part of the data slavery, giving their data in exchange for services. Not only that, they will be able to organize into data collectives or data co-operatives-sharing certain kinds of data as commons for reaching common goals.
